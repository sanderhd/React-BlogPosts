# My First React Project  

This is my first React project for school. It is a simple blog where users can create and read posts. The goal of this project is to learn the basics of React, like components, state, and props.  

## Features  
- Create and read blog posts  
- Simple and clean design  
- Built with React and modern JavaScript  

## Presentation  
At the end of this period, I will present this project and explain how it works and what I have learned.  

## Future Plans  
- Edit and delete posts  
- Add categories or tags
